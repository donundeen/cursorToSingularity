# cursorToSingularity
A project to see if there are interesting things I can do with AI in cursor IDE


The goal is to do minimal actual coding, and try to accomplish things I wouldn't think I could do on my own.

# Some goals

- talking to the computer to create new code and experiences
- controlling more of the workflow with the AI
- AI running on the terminal
- AI committing to github?
- interactive art things
- AI telling me how to wire up complex circuit projects
- AI generating different types of graphical content
- AI writing proposals, descriptions, artist statements, etc.
- in general making a more fun AI playground

# What I don't want to do
- create at that looks like AI hallucinations
